# Bombr  

Bombr is a social networking app built with Next.js, designed as a simplified Instagram clone with a unique twist: users can only post (bomb!) on their friends' profiles instead of their own.

This project is being developed for the **Frontend II** module of the **ProgramaÃ§Ã£o Web 23/25** course at **ETIC Algarve**.  

## Core Features  
- Sign up and log in to your account  
- Connect with friends  
- Post (bomb!) your friends directly on your friends' profiles. 
- Explore and engage with posts in a new way

# Further details coming soon ðŸš€
